# Kotlin Essentials - Tasks and Exercises

This project is designed to help you learn Kotlin through practical tasks and exercises. 
Each lesson contains a set of tasks that cover essential Kotlin concepts, allowing you to practice and reinforce your understanding.

To complete the tasks, you will need to implement the required functionality in Kotlin and run the tests provided in each lesson.

For me to grade you, you will need to commit and push your solutions to GitHub. [See instructions how to do that](./git-github-instructions.md).

## Assignments

See the [Assignments](./assignments/Assignments.md) file for a list of tasks and exercises for each lesson.

## Test your solutions

This project includes Gradle tasks to run tests for specific lessons and GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration.

## Available Test Tasks

The following Gradle tasks have been added to run tests for specific lessons:

- `testLesson01` - Runs tests for Lesson 01
- `testLesson02` - Runs tests for Lesson 02
- `testLesson03` - Runs tests for Lesson 03
- `testLesson04` - Runs tests for Lesson 04

You can run tests for a specific lesson using the Gradle wrapper:

```bash
# Run tests for Lesson 01
./gradlew testLesson01

# Run tests for Lesson 02
./gradlew testLesson02

# Run tests for Lesson 03
./gradlew testLesson03

# Run tests for Lesson 04
./gradlew testLesson04

# Run tests for all lessons
./gradlew test
```
